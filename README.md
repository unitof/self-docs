# Decision One

What to call the main folder of articles?

- `posts`?
  - too social media, just don't love
- `articles`?
  - too newsy
- `pages`?
  - too vague
- `endpoints`?
  - kinda like
  - as if this is an "API" for human writing
  - but could be confusing should I launch an _actual_ API
- `pieces`?
  - kinda like
- `documents`?
  - love the allusion to Living Documents (my inspiration and framework for this whole anti-blog system)
  - but implies more technical writing than prose
- `papers`?
  - too strictly academic
- `paraphs`?
  - also kinda like
  - has a [meaning](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/paraph)
  - too snooty?
- `Â¶s`?
  - should probably stick to ASCII
