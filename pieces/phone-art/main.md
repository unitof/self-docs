title: Phone Art
---
Since 2016 I've been collecting what I term Phone Art: creative uses of usually automated phone systems. Sometimes straightforwardly art pieces, sometimes marketing, sometimes for very technical testing purposes but repurposed something poetic when used by a person outside the industry.

### Dial-a-Poem
John Giorno's hotline that started it all. I've been doing a lot of research on this one, and much more is to come. Current number maintained, as far as I can tell, by The New Museum. Previous numbers:

#### (212) 628-0400‬
The original? Maintained by The Architectural League in 1969 and then MoMA in 1970, I think.

#### ‭(347) 763-8011‬
Maintained by MoMA. Shut down sometime around 2015.

#### (641) 793-8122‬
Maintained by The New Museum. Still active as of 2021, but in 2020 started charging 1¢/min on T-Mobile, with a preceding message that "The number you're dialing is outside of your plan, and will incur a one cent per-minute charge if you continue. You can hang up now to avoid the charge." before continuing to Dial-A-Poem.

### Harvard Sentence Hotline
This is my personal Mendela Effect. I will absolute confidence swear there was a 99% Invisible episode on Harvard Sentences. They contain every—or at least attempt to contain many—phonemes of a given dialect. Like pangrams, but for the IPA instead of just the A.

I cannot find that 99PI episode—or a similar episode of a different podcast I'm likely to have confused it with—anywhere.

### Quarterly Woolly Mammoth Facts Hotline
A new woolly mammoth fact every quarter, run by Harry’s. Discovered on back of Face Lotion bottle.

Seems to be stuck on the same fact since roughly Q3 2018: "You can determinte the age of a wolly mammoth like that of a tree: by counting the rings on its tusks."
