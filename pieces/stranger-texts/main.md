Cataloging the new series of strange spam texts I receive. My best guess is an attempt to clean spammer recipient lists by monitoring which get a reply?

Some of these may be genuine wrong numbers, but something just seems similarly _off_ about these. Especially how there's never a follow-up or correction for realizing the wrong number.

Posting in the hopes that others can report back if they get identical or variations of these same messages, or same numbers. In my experience these are nearly unGoogleable, so this page should quickly rise.

I have a (267) phone number. Registered circa 2009 on AT&T, ported to T-Mobile circa 2016 where it remains today.

All times NYC (Eastern) unless stated otherwise.
