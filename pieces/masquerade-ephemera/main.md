title: Masquerade Ephemera
subtitle: Les Chronoiques du Faubourg

A clockwork Phantom grabbed my hand on Saturday at the 1:30pm show of _Masquerade_, and handed me this broadside.

Once I code up spoiler text I’ll reveal moreso how it was handed to me, and where, and which article he indicated I should read.

No spoilers for the show, far as I can tell. Just lots of little references and flavor.

I think I also saw versions of this paper pasted to the windows of the Lee’s Art Shop, on 57th.

Of note: MDCCCXXXI would be 18**3**1, right?

And the pagination order: A, C, A, B.
