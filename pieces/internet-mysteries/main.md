# foo.bar

I found this in November 2022 wondering if anyone'd bought the domain `foo.bar`.

Apparently itâ€™s a programming challenge, likely recruitment tool for Google?

Many seem to have found it via a google search easter egg: https://support.google.com/chrome/thread/11372378?hl=en&msgid=31853357

Likely the challenge is logging in: https://foobar.withgoogle.com/denied/

<em>Update:</em> maybe not; looks like you actually _do_ get [invited into something](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-get-hired-by-google-b19806ad3c62), and those forum folks had some bug. Recruitment tool confirmed though.
