A living collection of strange or unsolved things I've found on the web

# [qfwfq.com](http://qfwfq.com)

My favorite Cosmicomics character, notably from _The Distance of the Moon_. Must figure out what this is/was/will be.

Discovered when I had the urge to buy the domain, but glad I don’t have to now.

# foo.bar

I found this in November 2022 wondering if anyone'd bought the domain `foo.bar`.

Apparently it’s a programming challenge, likely recruitment tool for Google?

Many seem to have [found it via a google search easter egg](https://support.google.com/chrome/thread/11372378?hl=en&msgid=31853357).

Likely the challenge is figuring out how to log in: [foobar.withgoogle.com/denied/](https://foobar.withgoogle.com/denied/).

<em>Update:</em> maybe not; looks like you actually _do_ get [invited into something](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-get-hired-by-google-b19806ad3c62), and those forum folks had some bug. Recruitment tool confirmed though.

# merveill.es

[Devine Lu Linvega](http://xxiivv.com), I presume, but I cannot decode `mdlolcoucou`. Their adorably French laughter in the face of Markdown, from [Pino](https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/pino.html)'s bow?
