# foo.bar

I found this in November 2022 wondering if anyone'd bought the domain `foo.bar`.

Apparently itâ€™s a programming challenge, likely recruitment tool for Google?

Many seem to have found it via a google search easter egg: https://support.google.com/chrome/thread/11372378?hl=en&msgid=31853357

Likely the challenge is logging in: https://foobar.withgoogle.com/denied/
